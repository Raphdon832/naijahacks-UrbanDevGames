Problem
Housing And Real Esate 

Proposed Solution
Using VR to develop modern Solution 
Proposed Stack
C#, Blender, Unity 3D, Html, Css, Javascript, Node.js

Upcoming Solution 
We are working on a dynamic solution to bridge the gap of cost and quality. Thisolution will helpto curb the situation whereby quality of building materials are tested virtually(Simulation) evenbefore these materials are bought, with the help of virtual reality.

Benefit 
COST: ​we hope to cut down the cost using virtual reality.Those interested in housing probablyfirst time housing agents or to be house owners / real estate moguls. Cost of transportation tointended building sites can be managed in the sense that real estate housing moguls canupload there building plans on our email, and 3d virtual reality renders can be made from themand sent back for viewing.COLLAPSING BUILDINGS: ​Building materials can be tested virtually via physics simulations,therefore the issue of collapsed buildings due to wrong choice of building materials can becheckmated.
HOUSING DESIGN: ​Real estate moguls can ​see ​what their houses or buildings will look like invirtual reality through real time virtual footage.
LOCATION:​ Houses to be leased can be ​seen ​in virtual reality through 360 images or 3drenders.
