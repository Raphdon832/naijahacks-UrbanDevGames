"Typically, a real estate agent provides a long list of properties to the client. Afterward come the explanations, negotiations, and finally the real-life visits to houses and apartments. This workflow has remained the same for decades, but in fact it's inconvenient and time-consuming not only for realtors but for homebuyers as well.

However, there's a game changer and it's already transforming the way the real estate industry functions – virtual reality (VR). The power of VR technology can help real estate agents grow their business, get more clients, and deliver top-level services. It's particularly important to adopt this new technology today when – according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors – 44% of clients search for properties on the internet first". -https://rubygarage.org/blog/virtual-reality-in-real-estate

Typically, clients visit multiple properties before deciding on the one they want. This requires a lot of time and things get complicated if a property is far from where a client lives. In this case, visiting a property is not only time-consuming but can be expensive.

VR technology helps solve these problems, allowing millions of people to virtually visit properties without leaving their homes. Simply put on a VR headset and you can experience immersive, three-dimensional walkthroughs of properties. In a matter of minutes, potential buyers or renters can virtually visit dozens of locations and decide which are worth visiting in person.
